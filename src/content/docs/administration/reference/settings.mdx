`settings.yml` is the first file to review after installation.

## High-impact fields

| Field | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| `general.server-id` | Uniquely identifies the node in synchronized environments |
| `general.language` | Selects the language file id |
| `general.include-prefix-in-messages` | Adds/removes configured prefix from plugin messages |
| `general.proxy-mode` (Paper) | Enables backend network-aware behavior |
| `general.purge-online-history-on-startup` (Velocity) | Clears online history state at startup |
| `vanish-command` / `command` | Main command name and aliases |

## Paper sample

```yaml
general:
  server-id: "sayanvanish-..."
  language: "en_US"
  include-prefix-in-messages: true
  bstats: true
  proxy-mode: false
vanish-command:
  name: "vanish"
  aliases: ["v", "sayanvanish", "sv"]
```

## Velocity sample

```yaml
general:
  server-id: "sayanvanish-..."
  language: "en_US"
  purge-online-history-on-startup: true
  purge-users-on-startup: true
  include-prefix-in-messages: true
command:
  name: "sayanvanishproxy"
  aliases: ["vp", "vanishp", "svp"]
```

:::caution
Keep server ids unique across nodes. Never deploy duplicated generated ids.
