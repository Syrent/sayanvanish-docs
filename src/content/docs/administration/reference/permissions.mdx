## Core vanish/action permissions

| Permission | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `sayanvanish.vanish.use` | Toggle/use vanish |
| `sayanvanish.commands.vanish.others` | Change vanish state for other players |
| `sayanvanish.action.vanish.onjoin` | Allow vanish-on-join |
| `sayanvanish.commands.feature.toggleplayer.other` | Change per-player feature state for others |
| `sayanvanish.action.vanish.invulnerable` | Invulnerability-related behavior |
| `sayanvanish.action.vanish.fly` | Allow fly while vanished |
| `sayanvanish.action.vanish.fly.keep_after_reappear` | Keep fly after unvanish |

## Level permissions

- `sayanvanish.level.<number>`

When level mode is `PERMISSION`, highest granted level controls visibility hierarchy.

## Feature-disable override permissions

- `sayanvanish.feature.disable.*`
- `sayanvanish.feature.disable.<feature_id>`

These nodes disable specific features for users during per-user feature checks.

## Command permissions

Command permissions are generated by the command framework from command paths.

In practice, grant:

- Root access for users who should run command entry points.
- `sayanvanish.commands.*` for full admin command control.
