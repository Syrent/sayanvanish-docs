SayanVanish is a modular vanish system with shared data/messaging layers and platform-specific runtime adapters.

## Supported runtime targets

| Target | Implemented here |
| --- | --- |
| Paper and Paper forks (including Folia) | Yes |
| Velocity | Yes |

## Module map

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `sayanvanish-api` | Shared interfaces, storage, cache, messaging, feature system |
| `sayanvanish-paper` | Paper runtime module (module name kept for API compatibility), commands, events, features |
| `sayanvanish-proxy` + `sayanvanish-proxy-velocity` | Proxy config/command base and Velocity runtime |

## Runtime lifecycle summary

1. Platform plugin registers the active `Platform` and adapter.
2. API initializes storage, messaging, and cache services.
3. Registered features are discovered and loaded from `features/*.yml`.
4. Runtime actions save to storage and optionally sync through messaging.

:::note
For networked deployments, use backend proxy mode plus shared storage.
