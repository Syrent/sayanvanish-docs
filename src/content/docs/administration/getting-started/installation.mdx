## Requirements

- Java 21 for current local run tasks in this project.
- One plugin build per platform (Paper build for backends, Velocity build for proxy).

:::caution
Spigot and CraftBukkit are not supported targets for this plugin. Use Paper/Folia or Paper-compatible forks.
:::

## Scenario A: standalone Paper/Folia

1. Place the Paper build in `plugins/`.
2. Start once to generate config files.
3. Keep `settings.yml -> general.proxy-mode: false`.
4. Restart after configuration changes.

Generated files include:

- `settings.yml`
- `storage.yml`
- `message.yml`
- `languages/en_US.yml`
- `features/`

## Scenario B: Velocity + Paper backends

1. Install Velocity build on proxy.
2. Install Paper build on every backend.
3. Set backend `settings.yml -> general.proxy-mode: true`.
4. Configure shared storage (`MySQL`/`MariaDB`/`Redis`).
5. Keep messaging/storage configuration consistent across all nodes.

:::caution
Do not run proxy mode on SQLite. The plugin warns about this at runtime for good reason.
