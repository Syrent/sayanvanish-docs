## Startup validation

- Plugin enables without storage or messaging errors.
- Main command responds:
- Paper default: `/vanish`
- Velocity default: `/sayanvanishproxy`
- Config files are generated in the plugin directory.

## Permission validation

- Operator/admin account has `sayanvanish.vanish.use`.
- Command root access is granted (`sayanvanish.commands.use` in practice).

## Behavior validation

- Vanish toggle works for self.
- Vanish visibility behaves as expected for another account.
- State persistence matches your intended mode (standalone vs proxy).

## Optional diagnostics (Paper)

- `/vanish test users`
- `/vanish test database data 5`
- `/vanish feature status state`
