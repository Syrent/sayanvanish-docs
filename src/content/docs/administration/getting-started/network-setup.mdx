Use this flow for Velocity networks with multiple Paper backend servers.

## 1. Install proxy plugin

- Install the Velocity artifact.
- Verify proxy data path is created and writable.

## 2. Install backend plugins

- Install Paper artifact on each backend.
- Enable `general.proxy-mode: true` on each backend.

## 3. Configure shared storage

- Configure `storage.yml` with a shared backend.
- Use identical connection targets across all nodes.

## 4. Configure messaging

- Configure `message.yml` for your transport choices.
- Keep category routing aligned across nodes.

## 5. Validate identity and sync

- Keep unique `general.server-id` per node.
- Never clone one node's generated plugin directory to another.
- Test vanish on server A, then move to server B and verify expected state.
