## Storage errors on startup

Typical signs:

- SQL/Redis initialization errors in logs.
- User or vanish state not persisting.

Checks:

1. Verify `storage.yml` credentials and host/port.
2. Confirm backend service reachability from server host.
3. Avoid SQLite when using proxy mode.

## Cross-server sync not working

Typical signs:

- Vanish updates apply locally but not on other nodes.

Checks:

1. Confirm backend `general.proxy-mode: true`.
2. Validate `message.yml` transport and category entries.
3. Confirm messaging transport is reachable.

## Commands denied

Typical signs:

- Command exists but sender is blocked.

Checks:

1. Grant root command permission for your command set.
2. Grant required action permissions (see [Permissions](../reference/permissions/)).
3. Verify vanish level/visibility logic for observer accounts.

## Feature settings appear ignored

Checks:

1. Confirm target feature file is enabled.
2. Confirm required hook plugin is installed and active.
3. Confirm per-user feature state was not toggled off.
