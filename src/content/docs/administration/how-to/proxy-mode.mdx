Enable proxy mode on Paper backends when you need cross-server vanish behavior.

## What changes

With `general.proxy-mode: true` on Paper:

- Messaging reload is enabled during API startup.
- Local standalone join/quit bookkeeping is reduced.
- Shared storage quality becomes critical.

## Migration steps

1. Install Velocity plugin.
2. Install/confirm Paper plugin on all backend nodes.
3. Set backend `settings.yml -> general.proxy-mode: true`.
4. Move storage off SQLite.
5. Restart proxy first, then backends.

## Rollback steps

1. Set backend `general.proxy-mode: false`.
2. Restart affected backends.
3. Re-validate standalone persistence behavior.

:::caution
Do not reuse copied plugin data directories when changing between modes.
