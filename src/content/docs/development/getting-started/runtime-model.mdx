## Startup sequence

1. Platform plugin sets and registers active `Platform`.
2. `SayanVanishAPI` initializes storage, messaging, and cache services.
3. Feature discovery loads `@RegisteredFeature` classes.
4. Runtime actions persist data and optionally publish sync messages.

## Core abstractions

| Type | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `VanishAPI` | Public API entry point |
| `Platform` | Active runtime metadata and adapter registration |
| `PlatformAdapter` | Converts shared models to platform-specific models |
| `Database` | Persistence contract (`TransactionDatabase` by default) |
| `MessagingService` | Cross-node propagation contract |
| `CacheService` | In-memory user/vanish snapshots |
| `FeatureRegistry` | Feature registration and per-user feature toggles |

## Defaults used by this project

- Storage: `TransactionDatabase`
- Messaging: `TypedMessagingService`
- Cache: `MemoryCacheService`
- Visibility policy: `DefaultVisibilityPolicy`
